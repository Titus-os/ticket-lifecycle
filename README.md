Creating tickets as an end-user (e.g., reporting “entire mobile/online banking system is down”) is essential because it simulates real-world customer issues, initiating the ticket lifecycle. This step drives the help desk’s core function of receiving and addressing user problems.

Observing ticket properties (Priority, Department, SLA, Assigned To) and setting them (e.g., Sev-A with 1-hour SLA, Online Banking Department) is critical for proper ticket triage. This ensures tickets are prioritized, assigned to the correct team, and handled within defined timeframes, aligning with service expectations.

Working tickets to completion as specific agents (e.g., Jane for the banking ticket, John for Adobe and CFO laptop issues) is vital as it represents the core resolution process. This step demonstrates how agents address user issues, update statuses, and close tickets, ensuring customer satisfaction.
